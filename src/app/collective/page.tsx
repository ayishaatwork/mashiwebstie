            The Travelling Picture Book Project started as a simple idea and
            grew into a shared creative journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            The project includes two books, one travelling from north to south,
            and the other from south to north. Each book moves from one artist
            to another, with every participant adding a story, drawing or
            thought to its pages.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the books travel, they collect different voices, places, and
            moments. Together they celebrate collaboration and the joy of shared
            making.
