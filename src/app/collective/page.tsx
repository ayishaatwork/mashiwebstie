              The Travelling Picture Book Project started as a simple idea and
              grew into a shared creative journey.
            </p>

            <p>
              The project includes two books, one travelling from north to
              south, and the other from south to north. Each book moves from one
              artist to another, with every participant adding a story, drawing
              or thought to its pages.As the books travel, they collect
              different voices, places, and moments.
            </p>

            <p>
              Together they celebrate collaboration and the joy of shared
              making.
